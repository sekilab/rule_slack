## Rule for daily usecase

- Don't use @channel/@here, since these mentions are notified to all members
- Post messages together in one post
- Post long sentences in a snippet
- Create a thread when multiple people are discussing different topics/ information is likely to be complicated/ the continuing conversation does not need to be seen by other members
- Avoid "OK" and "Confirmed" posts. Just respond with action
- Frequently delete channels that are no longer needed
- Don't use Direct Message
